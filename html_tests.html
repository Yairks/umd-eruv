<p>Humanity is facing a lot of fundamental challenges at the moment. Billions of people are food insecure while others
    are fabulously wealthy. The rich biodiversity which characterizes the planet is fast being destroyed. The globe is
    heating up, and we’re just not acting fast enough to prevent it from causing large-scale damage. Water is quickly
    becoming a treasured resource. None of these issues can be sustainably ignored. They must be addressed quickly and
    efficiently, to prevent the continued and future pain of billions of people. The difficulty is that all of the issues
    are simply symptoms of deeper problems that have plagued us for decades now and which are tremendously difficult to
    navigate properly. For example, we have been cutting down rainforests for wood and uprooting mountains for precious
    metals for centuries now, and solutions that would preserve the Earth’s invaluable resources and beauty are short in
    hand. Likewise, we face stark inequality, to the tune of the 500 wealthiest individuals earning about as much as the
    poorest 416 million, but until now we have had little government action stepping up and taxing those super-rich. 29%
    of the global population still lacked access to safe drinking services, while 61% had no safe sanitation Finally, of
    course, we would be remiss if we failed to mention the current COVID-19 epidemic, which has infected millions, shut
    down the globe, and caused mass food insecurity.

    Furthermore, these problems are often related to one another, and it is their very interconnectedness that makes it
    so difficult to resolve these issues. It is in the nature of corporations, for example, to focus solely on the bottom
    line. It is consequently not surprising to find Dow Chemical and Corning, Inc. lobbying for the US to exit the Paris
    Agreement, or that workers producing Nestle’s cocoa in West African earn far less than one dollar per day. A whole
    host of issues, including unethical lobbying, practices, and lack of concern for the general welfare, have to do with the current status and directive of limited liability corporations. Their purpose is to look out for themselves and
    their shareholders, not the public. Corporations were traditionally not involved in any kind of “general welfare”
    programs, as this was the purview of the government.
</p>
<div class="img center" style="width: 672px">

</div>
<p>
    However, the US government itself has notably failed in many general welfare programs. The United States has long
    suffered from an under-maintained infrastructure and lack of investment in our roads, bridges and trains.
    Additionally, despite the general agreement that climate change will challenge national and global security, increase
    vectors for disease, and put food supplies in jeopardy, the US government has resisted calls to action. It has
    avoided committing to responsibilities in the 1997 Kyoto Agreement or the 2015 Paris Agreements which it had been
    instrumental in creating. Though our current global issues are difficult to directly blame on individual entities,
    the uncaring profit seeking of corporations and mute US leadership has certainly not helped us toward any kind of
    solution.
</p>
<p>
    Everyone agrees, at least in principle, that the continued development of everyone’s well-being needs to be done in
    a sustainable manner. It’s rare to find someone argue callously that we don’t need to be careful about overusing the
    world’s resources. Given that agreement, an important reason that the globe is not currently on a path towards
    indefinite sustainability is because the word lost much of its meaning as agreement in its value grew. Although
    there may be value in sacrificing some of the precision of the word “sustainability” for the purpose of universal
    adoption, the resulting ambiguity is more problematic than helpful because it allows for co-opting of the term in
    the name of good public relations. Heather Farley and Smith Routledge note, for example, the increasing usage of the
    term “clean coal”, which is clearly self-contradictory. The issue is that the problematic corporations and
    governments can easily pay lip service to the vague concept of sustainability without actually changing any of their
    practices. This problem of ambiguity alone would be sufficient to push towards using a different word, or at least
    to clarify precisely what is meant by sustainability and sustainable development.
</p>
<p>
    The difficulty with even defining sustainability, though, is that even those genuinely concerned with the concept
    have differing notions of what the term ought to mean. The 20th century featured a prominent debate between the
    preservation and conservation camps about this very concept. The preservationists, led by John Muir and the Sierra
    Club, wanted to set aside large swaths of land to remain unused by human beings. In their eyes, the only way to
    preserve nature was to avoid usage of it. In contrast, the conservationists saw nature for its utilitarian value.
    Led by Gifford Pinchot, the conservationists felt that nature should be optimally used to support human use. These
    philosophical stances become more complex when one is to consider making use of both positions depending on the
    situation, as well as when considering the short term versus long term impacts. Without any sort of universal
    agreement on what sustainability should look like even among its most ardent supporters, it is of course impossible
    to expect any real “sustainable” actions from the entities that have no real interest in sacrificing for its sake.
</p>
<p>
    A hard, honest definition of sustainable development is critical. Luckily, we are not suffering from any dearth of
    proposals for how to best accomplish that goal. For example, the Brundtland Commission, first published at the
    United Nations’ directive in 1987, contains 112 recommendations and proposals for how to best proceed with
    development in a way that can be sustained for a long period of time. The Earth Summit in Rio De Janeiro in 1992 as
    well published a Declaration on Environment and Development as well as an Agenda 40 chapters strong on sustainable
    development in the 21st century. Evidently, then, the problem of defining sustainable development lies in adopting
    and enforcing one standard definition. Because many governments do not do that, malicious actors are still able to
    pretend to be pursuing a sustainable course of development while in reality changing nothing fundamental about
    their practices.
</p>
<p>
    Governments have an obligation to work on large-scale sustainability: enforcing a carbon tax, researching
    sustainable alternatives to polluting technologies, and working to reduce emissions on a global scale. For example,
    President Obama made a treaty with China back in late 2014, where both countries agreed to limit their carbon
    emissions over the following two decades. Many countries in the European Union have taken significant actions to
    reduce their pollution and emissions, such as the climate-protection plan implemented by Denmark. Because a
    government is supposed to look out for the general welfare of the people presides over, it is only natural that in
    light of the growing issues of climate change and its affiliate problems that governments would be the parties
    expected to step up and work to provide solutions for their people.
</p>
<p>
    Individuals, on the other hand, don’t have that ability. It is easy for individual people to feel a sense of
    powerlessness, that nothing they can do can solve the world’s problems. This can feel depressing. However,
    individuals are obligated to feel a sense of hope, because without a sense of hope there is little chance of any
    sort of collective action taking place. Humanity knows much more about the problems it is facing than it did at any
    time before now, and has more resources to solve its problems than at any time before the present. Consequently,
    our responsibilities as members of humanity are to demonstrate, however possible, our desire for change. This can
    take the form of using social media to register unhappiness with the trend toward greater emissions. It could
    happen by intentionally purchasing locally grown produce, to support local and self-sufficient farming practices.
    These practices add up. One individual practicing and promoting a life of sustainability may not directly improve
    the world by a significant margin, but large numbers of people acting together can. For each person that
    purposefully pursues sustainability in their lifestyle, many others around them become more informed and inspired.
</p>
<p>
    Individual action isn’t enough, though. In order to mitigate the effects of climate change and depletion of the
    natural environment, better global governance is needed. Countries from around the world have already participated
    in agreements to better attain sustainable development, most notably in the Paris Agreement, which was signed by
    197 countries. Apparently, nearly every country in the world agrees at least in principle to the need to drastically
    cut back emissions and limit global warming. Yet little of significance has been done: China ranks 118th out of 178
    countries in a broad group of metrics regarding environmental health, and India continues to rely heavily on
    coal-powered plants for its massive population. Meanwhile, the US continues to only move lazily towards sustainable
    development, funding for just three years research into new energy technology, among other minor moves in the right
    direction. The problem with international agreements such as the Paris Agreement is that there is no true enforcement
    mechanism. A country such as the US can simply ignore the treaty after signing, or even walk out if it so desired.
    While global governance would be useful if it could be implemented, the reality is that national governments hold
    far too much independent power for one to be of much use. A more direct means of achieving sustainable development
    would be for countries themselves to pursue the goal, as well as use their economic power to direct other countries
    towards sustainability.
</p>
<p>
    The United States could play a critical role in that regard. Since the US has the highest GDP in the world, it
    has tremendous potential. The US, by simply independently pursuing sustainable development, could cause tremendous
    change across the globe. If in addition to a pursuit of sustainability, the US also tried to lead other countries in
    the same direction, it could further help move the globe towards sustainability more quickly than previously possible.
    The United States has, in the past, often been a leader of coalitions, treaties, and international bodies; with its
    economic, political, and military might, the US has the potential to help greatly lower the world’s pollution and emissions.
</p>
<p>
    That potential, unfortunately, has largely gone to waste. Although the United States played a critical role in
    brokering previous international agreements, such as the 2015 Paris Agreement and the 1997 Kyoto Agreement, it also
    never ratified the 1997 agreement and recently left the 2015 one. For the most part, it has been countries in the
    European Union leading the way toward a sustainable future. Switzerland and Luxembourg have been rated by the
    Environmental Performance Index as countries with some of the most sustainable policies in place. Meanwhile, the
    United States has slid backwards and even undone some of the sustainable development policies it had in place from
    before. Without the help and support of the United States, international agreements can seem half-baked, given that
    the US sports the world’s largest economy. Still, if sustainable development is the only way for the future, then
    the United States’ continued lack of leadership will likely put it behind other countries that take up the mantle
    of leadership. The United States needs to put in an effort to independently pursue sustainable development policies,
    research sustainable alternatives, and encourage other countries to also adopt more sustainable policies.
</p>
<p>
    The lack of leadership from the United States government has resulted in a very surprising consequence: corporations
    are now trying to show off responsibility of their own. Without strict regulations enforcing actual sustainable
    practices among corporations and with a public that increasingly wants to see sustainable practices implemented,
    many corporations have seen a potential for good public relations. Many corporations are now showing off their new
    corporate social responsibility, where they take actions that they say pursue sustainable goals. Of course, some of
    these goals are complete nonsense: the concept of “clean coal”, for example is oxymoronic at best. Some sustainable
    practices of corporations do seem worthy of lauding, like the oil companies that, after the Exxon Valdez oil spill
    of 1989, came up with a corporate code of conduct that was designed to prevent future catastrophes. However, the
    general welfare and public good is not something that corporations are designed to care about. Their one task is
    earning money for their shareholders. Any pursuit of sustainable development that runs counter to a corporation’s
    monetary priorities is deceptive sleight of hand if done maliciously and foolish if done genuinely.
</p>
<p>
    Corporations are not supposed to be in charge of the public’s good. The fact that they have any relevance to the
    public good at the moment indicates that there is not enough regulation in place and that governmental guidance is
    missing. It also indicates that corporations have too much power. Further evidence for the tremendous economic power
    that corporations have is that Wal-Mart, in terms of total economic value, lies between Canada and Spain, and that
    the biggest corporations are more powerful than most countries in the world. Corporations have frequently advocated
    both sides of an issue: the popular one to the general public and the financially profitable one to legislatures.
    This kind of deceptive behavior is possible in large part because of a relative lack of action on the federal level.
</p>
<p>
    The younger generation feels that it has been disadvantaged by the problems created by the older generation. Coming
    into the stage after the problems of climate change have been well-researched but before they’ve even been agreed
    upon by our political leaders, Generation Z in particular may feel frustrated that they are being set up for
    failure. However, Generation Z may end up helping save the planet. If enough of the new generation are thoughtful
    and responsible, they may help the planet on to the greatest social revolution in all of history. The hope is that
    Generation Z can work to fix the mistakes of previous generations to create a better future.
</p>
<p>
    In order to work to fix the mess we are now in, drastic measures are going to need to be taken. First, the United
    States must adopt some of the now-standard techniques for lowering emissions: a carbon tax will have to be
    implemented, investments must be made in railroad infrastructure, and education programs regarding wastefulness and
    reuse should be created, among other basic procedures. Domestic measures will have to be pursued before any kind of
    international agreement can be made. Further domestic actions will include research on all kinds of renewable
    alternatives and reducing wasteful practices. There is tremendous potential for greatly increasing our
    renewable energy, but we have to take advantage of that potential now. Nonrenewable energy sources are going to run
    out eventually, so replacements must be prepared as soon as possible. Finally, enshrining a commitment to sustainability
    in the form of an amendment to the Constitution would go a long way in ensuring that sustainable actions are
    encouraged and carried out.
</p>
<p>
    Looking toward a larger scale, corporations must be regulated to reduce emissions and pollution. Given a free
    reign, the world’s corporations would ransack the world in order to secure the short term profits of their
    shareholders. While economic growth is important, it cannot compromise the health and safety of those who will come
    after us. Additionally, once domestic avenues for sustainable development have been pursued, it will be critical to
    create international treaties to reduce emissions globally. The United States is the world’s largest economy by GDP,
    so just fixing itself will reap plenty of rewards. But there is a lot to be gained by encouraging sustainable practices
    from other countries as well. In particular, because of the United States’ vast economic and military power, it has
    the unique ability to influence many other countries to work towards achieving their own domestic sustainable
    development. Once the United States is on board, it will be much easier to create a global coalition for sustainable
    action.
</p>
<p>
    As for myself, it can be hard to think that I as an individual can truly make a difference in the global fight to
    prevent climate change. This is going to take the effort of billions of people working together across decades to
    help solve. Yet I take courage in the fact that I do have the power to help towards that goal, however little my
    part may end up being. Ultimately, each one of us has the ability to make the world a little bit better for those
    who will come after us, just as we each have the ability to make it a little worse. I don’t pretend that I am going
    to solve the world’s problems; in fact, I am thankful every day that I don’t have to make the decisions that will
    affect the lives of millions of people. Yet even so I know that with every action I take, I am making a difference.
    I hope that by pushing for the goals of reduced emissions and sustainable development, I will help better the lives
    of those who will live on this planet long after I am gone.
